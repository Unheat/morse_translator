## Lab 0: Intro to Physical Computing 
### Reflection

### Authors: Sneha, An, Luke


### Overview
(What were you asked to create in this lab? What problems were involved in reaching this goal and what concepts did you need to solve them?)

We were asked to first blink the Pico device, then buzz it. Essentially, we were supposed to use the pico to play morse code for at least three words containing three letters. There were some minor problem that we faced during the lab. Firstly connecting the pico perfectly was a taska s sometimes, it would not work correctly. There were other peoblems regarding programming like use the right code at right time. We had to be very careful about when we use what function like if or sleep. 

### Solution
(Describe your implementation. This can be at a high level but should concretely describe your solution. For example: "We simulated rolling a pair of dice by generating two random numbers between one and six using Python's random module.")

We use the morse code website to first know how the dot and dash works. We then using different functions we learned in class, coded the final three words of at least three letters, then connected the pico and use the device to play the morse code. 

### Challenges
(What challenges did you encounter in completing this lab and how did you overcome them?)

We facedd some challenges in firstly understanding how to use the pico and connecting it to the computer. We also had some difficult to exactly when to use the appropriate functions in the code. Using semicolon or function like if and sleep and def, it was important to understand that. We has to be very careful about maintaining the hardware of the pico to the laptop for a smooth use. We overcame all this by concentrating and using all our class notes and understanding the question first then working.

### Achievements
(What are you most proud of about what you built in this lab? Did you extend any of the requirements in any way? If so, describe what you did and how)

I am most proud of learning a new concept from this lab. It also gave us an insight on how the morse code works and people used to comunicate with this. We tried to use the latest functions we used in class like def and if. 


### Takeaways
(What are three lessons learned that you can take from this lab? These could relate to course content, or could be higher-level reflections on project planning, etc.)

The three things that we learned through this lab are:
Using an external device like pico to play morse codes 
Using appropriate function like def, sleep, if
Try to complete the work before the pressure of deadline comes

### Ethical Reflection
(Sometimes this section may be more relevant than others, but I want you to go through the exercise each time. Are there any ethical considerations around anything you worked with in this lab? This could be positive--for example, imagine how some technology could be used for good, or it could have to do with how some aspects of the technology could be misused or misappropriated. If not, explain why not.)

I think techonology can definetly be used for many good and positive aspects. This lab made me realize how people used to use morse code to communicate secretly for national and military use. Technolgy can be used positively for stuff like this. However, people can also take advantage of technology to use it negatively and harm others for sure. From this lab, I think that technology has been used in a postivie light as this could be used for bigger issues and times of national security. 

### Contribution Statement
(List how each teammate contributed to this lab, including planning, implementation, building, documenting, demo-ing, and writing up the reflection. I reserve the right to adjust grades individually if the contributions are heavily skewed.)

In the class lab, everyone partcipated to initially blink the pico. Later, Sneha went to the lab help session on Thrusday and did the coding for buzzing the pico. She also got started on the last part of morse code to initially start the coding. An then helped in the final coding of the morse code. He also explained in the video about the coding, he used. Sneha helped in recording the video and doing the reflection, and also finally submitting everything on canvas.
